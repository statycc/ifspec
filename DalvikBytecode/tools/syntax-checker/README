Checks the syntactic correctness of a RIFL specification for
Dalvik bytecode. The checker supports versions of RIFL up to
1.1.

To be applicable to a RIFL specification, the specification
must contain the following document type declaration: 
  <!DOCTYPE riflspec SYSTEM [dtd]>
Here, [dtd] is the path to a DTD for a version of RIFL for
Dalvik bytecode, e.g., "../rifl-DalvikBytecode-1.1.dtdâ€œ.

To run the tool, call:
  java -jar rifl-syntaxchecker-1.1-dalvik.jar [rifl],
where [rifl] is the path to the RIFL specification to be
checked.
