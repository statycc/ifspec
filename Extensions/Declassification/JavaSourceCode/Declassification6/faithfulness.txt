The specification correctly defines the length and content of int arrays as high
source of information.  Furthermore, the specification correctly defines the
return value of the method getAverageSalaries a a low sink.  Together this
captures that there should be no information flow from the array salaries to the
return value of the method getAverageSalries.  The desired exceptions to this
requirement are defined by the escape hatch "salaries.length == 0" and the
escape hatch "(\sum int i; 0 <= i && i < salaries.length; salaries[i])/salaries.length".  
That is, because the two escape hatches together express that the fact whether
the length of salaries is 0 or the average of the content of the array salary
may be declassified at the beginning of the method.
