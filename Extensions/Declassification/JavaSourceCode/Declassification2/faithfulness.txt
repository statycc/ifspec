The specification correctly defines the longitude and latitude fields of the parameter Location as input to the method onLocationChanged as a high source of information. Furthermore, the specification defines the parameter of println as a low sink. The specification also defines that no information may flow from high to low. Furthermore, the specification correctly defines an escape hatch Math.abs(eiffel.latitude-lat) <= 0.1 && Math.abs(eiffel.longitude-lon) <= 0.1 with a reference point before the if-condition of the method onLocationChanged. Hence, the specification faithfully captures that no information may flow from the latitude and longtitude fields of the Location object provided as input to the method onChangedLocation(Location s) to standard output except if both longitude and latitude differ at most by 0.1 from the location of the Eiffel tower.
Moreover, the specification defines the fields longitude and latitude of all other objects of the class Location as a low source. Hence, the specification faithfully captures that there is no restriction of the flow information of objects returned by the method getPointOfInterest(String name).
