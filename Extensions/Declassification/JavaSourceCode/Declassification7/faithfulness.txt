The specification correctly defines the length and content of int arrays as high
source of information.  Furthermore, the specification correctly defines the
return value of the method getAverageSalaries a a low sink.  Together this captures that
there should be no information flow from the array salaries to the return value
of the method getAverageSalries.  The desired exception to this requirement is
defined by the the escape hatch "(\sum int i; 0 <= i && i < salaries.length; salaries[i])/salaries.length".  That is,
because the escape hatch expresses the fact that the average of the content of the array salary may be
declassified at the beginning of the method.
