The specification correctly defines both fields of the class Password as high
sources of information. This faithfully captures that pairs of usernames and
passwords are confidential. Furthermore, the specification correctly defines the
return value as a low sink. Moreover, the specification correctly defines the
escape hatch "\exists int i; names[i] == user && passwords[i] == password"  
with a reference point at the beginning of the method check. The escape hatch
express that fact whether there is an index such that the provided input matches
the username and password at this index. Together this faithfully captures that
there shall be no information flow from the pairs of username and password
internally to the return value of the method except that there exists a pair
username and password matching the provided input or not.
