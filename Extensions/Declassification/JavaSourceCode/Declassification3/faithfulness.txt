The specification correctly defines both fields of the class Name as a low source of information. This faithfully captures that names in general are not confidential. 
Furthermore, the fields data.name.firstName, data.name.lastName and data.creditCardNr are defined as high sources of information. In addition, the field data.validUntil is defined as a low source of information. Furthermore, the method println is defined as a low sink. Finally, an escape hatch is defined for the expression data.creditCardNr % 10000 directly before informing the user via standard output except for the last 4 digits of the value stored in data.creditCardNr. This faithfully captures that there may be no information flow from the fields data.name.firstName, data.name.lastName and data.creditCardNr to standard output.
