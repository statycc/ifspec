This example was extracted from DroidBench: https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench.
We have extracted one RIFL specification which mentions all sources and sinks which were mentioned in any DroidBench example.
You can convince yourself of that by examining the source code at https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/DroidBench/tree/master/eclipse-project/FieldAndObjectSensitivity/ObjectSensitivity1
Hence, this RIFL specification should be as least as restrictive as the desired security policy. It could be refined for this particular
example by removing sources/sinks. Then it would express truly faithfully the desired security property.
